## Problem
Ensure that a class has just a single instance. Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? 
The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resourceâ€”for example, a database or a file.


## Solution
All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the new operator with the Singleton class.
Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. 
Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field.
All following calls to this method return the cached object.
