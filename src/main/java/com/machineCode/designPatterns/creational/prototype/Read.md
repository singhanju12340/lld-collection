The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing instance (the "prototype") rather than instantiating a class directly. This can be useful when the process of creating an object is costly or complex, or when you want to avoid tightly coupling your code to specific classes.
Pros
Performance:
Cloning objects can be faster than re-creating them, especially when the object construction process is complex.

Flexibility:
The client code can work with objects through a common interface and create new objects by cloning prototypes, reducing dependencies on concrete classes.

Simplifies Object Creation:
Reduces the number of classes needed (e.g., by not having to implement a separate factory for every type).

Cons
Cloning Complexity:
Implementing a proper clone method can be error-prone, particularly for objects with deep object graphs or mutable references.

Shallow vs. Deep Copy:
A shallow copy might not suffice if the object contains references to other mutable objects.
