shopping cart system where you have different types of items,
like books and fruits.
 In current implementation Each item might require a calculation for its cost with 105 discount only.
 But later we may need calculation based on current season like in summer orange prices will be 50%,
  AC prices will be increased by 20%.

Imbedding these calculation in item class will require frequent changes in original classes.
Visitor pattern allows us to have different calculation in different classes for all the items.
Adding new type of calculation need only addition of new visitor implementation, and original items will not be modified.
