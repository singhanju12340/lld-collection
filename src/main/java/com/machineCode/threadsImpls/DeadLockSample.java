     *  Creating a deadlock involves two or more threads waiting for each other to release a resource they need.
     * Create two threads, each trying to lock two resources in a different order
     *
     * Ensure that one thread locks resource A first and then tries to lock resource B, while the other thread locks resource B first and then tries to lock resource A
     *
     * This will result in a situation where each thread is waiting for the other to release the resource it needs, causing a deadlock
