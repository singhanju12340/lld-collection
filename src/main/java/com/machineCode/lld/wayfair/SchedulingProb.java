     * Solve DSA problem :
     * Question : Given an array task memory of n positive integer representing
     * the amount of memory required to process each task.
     *  an array task type of n positive integer reprensenting the type of each task.
     * and an integer max_memory.
     *
     * find the minimum amount of time required for the server to process the task.
     * Each task takes 1 unit of time to process. The Server can process at most two task in parallelonly
     * if they are of the same type and together require no more than max_memory unit of memory.
     *
     * Example :
     * Suppose n=4, task_memory={7,2,3,9}, task_type={1,2,1,2} and max_memory=10
     * Answer : 3
     *
     * Function Description
     * Complete the function getMinTime()
     *
     * Return
     * int the minimum time required to process the all task.
